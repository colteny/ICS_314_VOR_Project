ICS_314_VOR_Project
===================
Colten Yamamoto, 
ICS 314

For Console/Terminal VOR:
Download Calculation.java and VOR.java.  Compile both and run VOR.java in the console.  Once running, you can input any
degree, 0 - 360, to change the heading of the VOR and see the VOR react to the changes.  Every time the VOR is ran, a
random angle is chosen to be the direction where the station is.  From there, everything else is calculated from what
angle the user inputs.  To exit the program, enter any number outside of 0 to 360.
